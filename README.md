# BUDDIE'LAM APP
An Application that has an intelligence 
solution of tracking daily ,weekly and 
monthly bookings and suggest a better 
balance booking for the upcoming month/s 
has been developed.
 Caregivers/Parents will be reminded of the 
patient/s(children(s)/adolescent(s) 
appointment 2-3 days prior the date.  A more easy effective way to request new 
appointments have been created. Which will 
prove accountability of caregivers/parents 
when coming to honoring appointments.  When a patient/s is or are supposed to be 
transferred to a local facility from the 
hospital a more convenient facility can be 
suggested to the caregivers/parents so as 
one facility should not be over crowed over 
other while in the same demographic 
location.  Ensuring compliance is maintained is key 
hence caregivers/parents can set treatment 
time(s) on the application to support 
adherence.  Caregivers/Parents are expected or 
encourage to know treatments the patient/s 
is or are on as well as the correct treatment 
dosages, that information can be easy access 
by the caregivers/parents on the application.
 Measures of authentication have been put in 
place to ensure compliance with POPI Act.
